# Baseball-Simulator
##About
Ongoing project designed at creating a semi-realistic baseball simulator. 

Currently only generates the current average OBP of entered batters.
##Goals
Short-term: use Bill James' Log5 method to determine match-up averages and then simulate game inning to inning to produce result.
Log5 method: http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/btf/scholars/levitt/articles/batter_pitcher_matchup.htm
(assumption will be made that league consists of these 2 teams)

Long-term: Expand input criteria to include more variables to enhance realism.  Allow entry of current league player names and either query internet sources or consult tables to gather data.  

Move from forms to a more visually appealing presentation medium.
